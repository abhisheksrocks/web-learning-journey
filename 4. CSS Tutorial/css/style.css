/*
  Universal selector
  ------------------

  As the name suggests, it applies declaration inside it to all the elements.

  It is different than applying your rules to <html> element. As in this case,
  all the rules are applied to all child elements, whereas in the other case,
  some property like "border" won't be applied to it's decendant elements.
