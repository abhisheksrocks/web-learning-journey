      <form> as the name suggests, is used with form data.

      'action' attribute is used to specify the end-address(endpoint)
      through with communication will happen.

      'method' attribute in form is used to specify HOW the data is transferred,
      i.e. GET('get')/POST('post'). By default it takes get

      <input> is used to provide different kinds of inputs, like textfields, submit
      button, checkbox, etc. We specify the type of input we want using the 'type'
      attribute in <input>.
        e.g.  <input type='text'> (for textfields),
              <input type='checkbox'> (for checkboxes), etc.

        -> input also has an attribute called 'name', which is used as the
          KEY(like KEY-VALUE pair) when the data is sent to servers.

        -> like all other tags, it also has 'id' attribute which is used to access it,
          or to move to highlight it.

        -> it also has an attribute called 'value' which can be used to hold a
         pre-existing value in the element(if the type supports it)

        -> it also has an attribute called 'placeholder' which is similar to value,
         but is much better suitable for a placholder text which only gives an
         indication to the user on what to write in the input.
      
      <label> is used as the label for another form element(like <input>).
      If we specify the 'for' attribute, which holds the id of the tag for which we
      are using this label for, then clicking on this label will highlight that element.

        Provides some default email validation, but should be considered
        as a really good one. So must create your own in real world projects.

        Another way to write this with better alignment is by using tables.
