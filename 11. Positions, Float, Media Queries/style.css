/*
  Z-INDEX

  Think of z-index like a way to organize element in a stack.
  
  -> The higher the z-index, the higher the element(on the top).
  
  -> If two element have same z-index, they will arrange them-selves
  in the order they are written in html code(the lowest written element
  at the top). See #img1 and #img3 for example.

  -> The default z-index for an element is 0.

  ! REQUIREMENTS
  
  ! -> For an element to support z-index, it must use "position: absolute;"
  ! or "position: fixed;" or "position: sticky". 
  ! IT DOES NOT WORK WITH "position: static;" OR "position: relative;"
